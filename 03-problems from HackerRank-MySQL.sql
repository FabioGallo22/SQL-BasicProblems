/* (Description from https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/more-than-75-marks/problem)
Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

Input Format
	Column	Type
	ID	Integer
	Name	String	
	Marks	Integer
	
The Name column only contains uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.
The STUDENTS table is described as follows:  

Sample Input
	______________________
	ID	Name		Marks
	1	Ashley		81
	2	Samantha	75
	4	Julia		76
	3	Belvet		84
	______________________
	
Sample Output:
	Ashley
	Julia
	Belvet
	
Explanation:
Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have Marks > 75. If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.

/* (Description from https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/what-type-of-triangle/problem)
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

	________________
	Column	Type
	A	Integer
	B	Integer
	C	Integer
	________________
	
Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input
	___________
	A	B	C
	20	20	23
	20	20	20
	20	21	22
	13	14	30
	___________

Sample Output
	Isosceles
	Equilateral
	Scalene
	Not A Triangle
	
Explanation
Values in the tuple (20,20,23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A≡B.
Values in the tuple (20,20,20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A≡B≡C. 
Values in the tuple (20,21,22) form a Scalene triangle, because A<>B<>C.
Values in the tuple (13,14,30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

/* (Description from https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-pads/problem)
Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

2. There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

Input Format
	___________________
	Column		Type
	Name		String
	Occupation	String

/* (Description	from https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/earnings-of-employees/problem)
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary * months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

Input Format

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:
	_________________________
	Column			Type
	employee_id		Integer
	name			String
	months			Integer
	salary			Integer
	_________________________

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary.

Sample Input
	__________________________________________
	employee_id		name		months		salary
	12228			Rose		15		1968
	33645			Angela		1		3443

	98607			Tood		5		3396
	99989			Joe		9		3573
	__________________________________________
	
Sample Output:
	69952 1

Explanation:
The table and earnings data is depicted in the following diagram:
	____________________________________________________________
	employee_id		name		months	salary			earnings
	12228			Rose		15		1968		29520
	33645			Angela		1		3443		3443
	45692			Frank		17		1608		27336
	56118			Patrick		7		1345		9415
	59725			Lisa		11		2330		25630
	74197			Kimberly	16		4372		69952
	78454			Bonnie		8		1771		14168

	____________________________________________________________
	
The maximum earnings value is 69952. The only employee with earnings = 69952 is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned $69952 (which is 1) as two space-separated values.

/*	(Description from https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-report/problem)
You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.
	_________________
	Column	Type
	ID	Integer
	Name	String
	Marks	Integer
	_________________
	
Grades contains the following data:
	______________________________
	Grades		Min_Mark		Max_Mark
	1		0			9
	2		10			19	
	3		20			29
	4		30			39

	8		70			79
	9		80			89
	10		90			100
	______________________________

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.

Sample Input
	______________________
	ID	Name		Marks
	1	Julia		88
	2	Samantha	68
	3	Maria		99
	4	Scarlet		78
	5	Ashley		63	
	6	Jane		81
	______________________

Sample Output
	Maria 10 99
	Jane 9 81
	Julia 9 88 
	Scarlet 8 78
	NULL 7 63
	NULL 7 68

Note:
Print "NULL"  as the name if the grade is less than 8.

Explanation:
Consider the following table with the grades assigned to the students:	
	_________________________________
	ID	Name		Marks		Grade
	1	Julia		88		9
	2	Samantha	68		7
	3	Maria		99		10
	4	Scarlet		78		8
	5	Ashley		63		7
	6	Jane		81		9
	_________________________________

So, the following students got 8, 9 or 10 grades:
	- Maria (grade 10)
	- Jane (grade 9)
	- Julia (grade 9)
	- Scarlet (grade 8)
